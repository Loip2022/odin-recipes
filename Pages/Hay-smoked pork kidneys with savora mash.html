           <h2>Follow these steps to cook our Hay-smoked pork</h2>
           <ol>
            <li>Start by preparing the hay. If it's wet or damp, place into an oven set to a low temperature until completely dry. Once dry, place into a large saucepan.</li>
            <li>Light the hay on fire and stand away from the flame. After all the hay is burnt, cover with a lid to extinguish the flames and then cover with water. Allow to slowly simmer for 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Pass the smoky hay-infused water through a fine strainer and pour into a smaller saucepan. Bring to the boil, remove from the heat and add the kidney's. Leave the kidneys in the stock until cool. This will gently poach them, creating a smooth texture</li>
            <li>Place the potatoes into a pan filled with cold water and gently boil for 20â€“30 minutes. Once cooked, but still firm and hot, put them through the vegetable mill (mouli) or ricer</li>
            <li>Once the potatoes are finely mashed, add the savora, diced butter (one by one - so they have time to melt) and the milk to finish. Keep stirring all the time. Taste and season if needed</li>
            <li>For the sauce, add the double cream, mustard, vermouth, garlic, salt and pepper into a small saucepan. Bring to the boil for 5 minutes and set aside</li>
            <li>Remove the kidneys from the water and dry with absorbent kitchen towel. Heat a small amount of butter in a frying pan. Gently pan-fry the kidneys until golden on both sides</li>
            <li>To serve, slice the kidneys into small portions and plate with the savora mash. Drizzle with the sauce and serve immmediately</li>
